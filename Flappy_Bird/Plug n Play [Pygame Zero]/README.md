# What is the Plug n Play version?

This option for running Flappy Bird with PyGame Zero comes with a "Plug n Play" piece of software to make it easy to run without installing things.

The software is a pre-packaged version of Python and Pygame Zero that doesn't need to be installed on the computers. This works for **Windows Only**. 

This package also included all the images needed for making Flappy Bird and a flappy_bird.py file that already has the coding coment-scaffold for students to use. 

## How do I use it?

There is an instruction sheet that you can print out to have on the day "Pygame Zero Plug n Play Setup Instructions.pdf"

1. Put a copy of the Flappy Bird Python.zip file on each computer being used for the workshop. 

2. Unzip the file. 

3. Run the .exe file to run IDLE. 

4. Use "Open" to open the file flappy_bird.py

The kids are ready to code!
