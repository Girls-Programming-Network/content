## Password Cracker solutions

Welcome to the code for Password Cracker. 

This code takes documents from a 'data leak', and allows you to 'hack'a meme exchange (https://girls-programming-network.github.io/meme-exchange/). You must brute force check if you can match any of the leaked passwords with the hashed versions that have known usernames. 

These solutions follow 3 workbooks, with each building on the last (complete book 1 --> book 2 --> book 3) 

## Workbook Structure
Students will create 3 files 
    - main.py 
    - rainbow.py 
    - salty_guesser.py

They will also create the folder 'rainbow_tables'
You will see there are also advanced versions of some of the solutions 

You can follow along with the workbooks in this order 

    Workbook 1 --> main.py 
    Workbook 2 --> rainbow.py 
    Workbook 3 part 1-2 --> advanced_main.py 
    Workbook 3 part 3-5 --> salty_guesser.py 
    Workbook 3 part 6 --> advanced_rainbow.py 


## Folder Structure
The workspace contains two folders, where:

- `rainbow_tables`: contains the text files and our rainbow table
    Contains: 
        - 'rainbow.py' - this is workbook 2's solution 
        - 'advanced_rainbow.py' - this is workbook 3 part 6's solution
        - 'common-passwords.txt'- list of most common passwords 
        - 'accounts.txt'- list of account names with their hashed passwords
        - 'salty-accounts.txt'- list of account names with their salted + hashed passwords 
        - 'account_info.txt' - workbook 1, extension 6. A list of usernames, hashed passwords, common passwords for you to test

- `code_output`: contains the output of the code aka the matched usernames and passwords 
    Contains: 
        - password-answers: logins generated by workbook 2, file 'rainbow.py'
        - salty-answers: logins generated by workbook 3, file 'advanced_rainbow.py'
