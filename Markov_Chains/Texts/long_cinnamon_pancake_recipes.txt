 first make the fondant it needs to be refrigerated overnight before using to make the fondant youll need a marble slab or a baking sheet and an offset spatula to fold the candy if youre using a baking sheet rinse it with water leaving a few drops on the pan
 dissolve the cream of tarter in the water in a heavybottomed saucepan add the sugar and bring the mixture to a boil over mediumhigh heat swirl the pan occasionally to help dissolve the sugar do not stir once the sugar syrup begins to boil heat to 240 degrees f 115 degrees c or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a soft ball that flattens when removed from the water and placed on a flat surface
 immediately pour the candy onto the baking sheet or marble slab and let cool for 10 minutes use a spatula to vigorously knead the candy folding it over itself knead until it begins to look cloudy 5 to 10 minutes allow it to cool transfer the fondant to a heatproof bowl or the top of a double boiler refrigerate overnight
 to make the sponge dissolve the yeast and 1 teaspoon sugar in 14 cup of the roomtemperature milk pour the remaining 12 cup milk into the bowl of a stand mixer add 1 cup of flour and the yeast mixture mix with a fork to combine cover the bowl with a towel and allow to rest until bubbly 10 to 15 minutes
 stir the remaining 3 cups of flour 14 cup sugar salt roomtemperature eggs and zest from 1 lemon into the sponge use the dough hook to mix the dough on the lowest setting mix the dough for about 5 minutes occasionally scraping the dough off of the hook and down the sides of the bowl
 increase the speed to mediumlow and add the softened butter 1 tablespoon at a time until fully incorporated allow the dough to mix for an additional  5 minutes scraping the dough down as needed add the ground almonds and turn the mixer on for 1 or 2 turns mixing just until incorporated transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and shape it into a ball place the ball in an oiled mixing bowl and cover with plastic wrap and a kitchen towel and let it rise until doubled 1 12 to 2 hours
 while the dough is rising prepare the filling heat the milk in a heavy 4quart saucepan until it begins to boil stir in the butter and sugar remove the pan from the heat and add the poppyseeds 1 12 teaspoons of lemon zest and the cinnamon let the mixture stand for 30 minutes to soften the poppyseeds when the mixture is cool whisk in the egg
 punch down the dough and roll it out into a 10 12 by 16inch rectangle spread the filling evenly over the dough leaving a 1inch margin on all sides roll the dough up into a log starting with the long side and pinch the edges together to form a seam place the loaf seamside down on a parchmentlined baking sheet cover it with greased plastic wrap or a wellfloured kitchen towel and allow it to rise for an additional 30 to 40 minutes
 preheat an oven to 400 degrees f 200 degrees c
 bake the stollen until golden brown on the bottom of the loaf about 40 minutes let the bread cool completely before glazing
 to glaze the bread add the lemon juice to the fondant place the bowl  over a pan of  simmering water stirring frequently with a rubber spatula until soft and glossy pour the fondant over the stollen and allow it to cool before slicing

 3 tablespoons sugar
 2 25 ounce packages active dry yeast
 14 cup lukewarm water
 1 cup milk
 12 cup heavy cream
 1 egg
 1 tablespoon water
 
 
 sprinkle 2 tablespoons of flour over the butter and mix it together with your hands in a mixing bowl or on a work surface transfer the butter to a length of foil or parchment paper and pat it into a 6 inch square fold up the foil to make a packet and refrigerate until chilled about 2 hours
 combine 2 cups of the flour with the salt and sugar in a mixing bowl dissolve the yeast in the lukewarm water 100 degrees f38 degrees c and set aside until frothy about 10 minutes meanwhile warm the milk and the heavy cream to lukewarm add the yeast milk and cream to the flour mixture and stir well the dough will have a batterlike consistency
 stir in the remaining 2 cups of flour 14 cup at a time to form a soft dough it should no longer be sticky turn the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead until smooth about 5 minutes place the dough in a mixing bowl and cover with plastic wrap refrigerate for 1 hour
 to begin the rolling and folding process both the butter and the dough should be at a cool room temperature see cooks note place the dough on a floured surface and roll it into a 10inch square set the block of butter diagonally on the square dough bring each point of dough to the center of the butter square the edges of the dough should overlap pinch the edges together to seal
 starting from the center of the square and working outward use a rolling pin to roll the dough out into a rectangle the butter should be pliable enough to roll smoothly with the dough if its too soft and starts to ooze out the corners wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate before proceeding roll the dough into a long rectangle approximately 8 by 18 inches fold the length of dough into thirds like a business letter
 if the dough is still cool you can continue with another fold otherwise wrap it in plastic and refrigerate for 45 minutes to 1 hour remove the dough from the refrigerator and let it warm up for about 10 minutes before you begin rolling it out again
 position the dough so that the open ends are at 12 and 6 oclock  roll the dough into a rectangle working from the center of the dough and pressing outwards reposition the dough as necessary to fit your work space you should have a long rectangle for the book fold fold both ends of the dough into the middle the ends dont have to be touching but should be close fold the alreadyfolded dough in half it will look like a thick book wrap the dough well with plastic and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours
 remove the dough from the refrigerator and let it rest at room temperature for about 20 minutes roll the dough into a rectangle again and fold it into thirds like a business letter wrap it in plastic and refrigerate for 46 hours or overnight
 to shape the croissants roll the dough into a 10 by 38inch rectangle on a lightly floured work surface it should be about 14 inch thick use a pizza wheel or sharp paring knife to trim the edges of the dough divide the rectangle in half so that you have two 5inch wide strips of dough use a clean yardstick to mark each strip into triangles that are 5 inches wide at their bases cut the triangles and place them onto parchmentlined baking sheets chill for 15 to 20 minutes if necessary
 starting at the base of the triangle roll the dough up into a log the tip of the triangle should be under the body of the croissant to prevent it from unraveling bend in the corners to form the traditional crescent shape repeat with the remaining dough
 arrange the croissants on the parchmentlined baking sheets and allow to rise until doubled in size about 1 to 2 hours
 preheat an oven to 425 degrees f 220 degrees c beat the egg with the tablespoon of water to make the egg wash brush the croissants with egg wash and bake in the preheated oven until deep brown 22 to 25 minutes cool on a rack before serving
