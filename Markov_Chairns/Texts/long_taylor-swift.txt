 without me without me without me and hes long gone
 when hes next to me

 so shame on me now
 flew me to places id never been
 so you put me down oh

 oh oh trouble trouble trouble
 oh oh trouble trouble trouble no apologies

 that hes the reason why
 youre drowning youre drowning youre drowning and i heard you moved on
 from whispers on the street
 a new notch in your belt

 oh oh trouble trouble trouble
 oh oh trouble trouble trouble i knew you were trouble when you walked in
 trouble trouble trouble
 i knew you were trouble when you walked in
 trouble trouble trouble long were the nights when my days once revolved around you
 counting my footsteps
 praying the floor wont fall through again
 my mother accused me of losing my mind
 but i swore i was fine you paint me a blue sky
 and go back and turn it to rain
 and i lived in your chess game
 but you changed the rules every day
 wondering which version of you i might get on the phone
 tonight well i stopped picking up and this song is to let you know why dear john i see it all now that youre gone
 dont you think i was too young to be messed with
 the girl in the dress cried the whole way home i shouldve known well maybe its me and my blind optimism to blame
 maybe its you and your sick need to give love then take it away
 and youll add my name to your long list of traitors who dont understand
 and ill look back and regret how i ignored when they said run as fast as you can dear john i see it all now that youre gone
 dont you think i was too young to be messed with
 the girl in the dress cried the whole way home dear john i see it all now it was wrong
 dont you think nineteen is too young
 to be played by your dark twisted games when i loved you so
 i shouldve known you are an expert at sorry
 and keeping the lines blurry
 never impressed by me acing your tests
 all the girls that youve run dry
 have tired lifeless eyes
 cause you burned them out
 but i took your matches before fire could catch me
 so dont look now im shining like fireworks over your sad empty town dear john i see it all now that youre gone
 dont you think i was too young to be messed with
 the girl in the dress cried the whole way home i see it all now that youre gone
 dont you think i was too young to be messed with
 the girl in the dress wrote you a song
 you shouldve known you shouldve known
 dont you think i was too young you shouldve known i am not the kind of girl
 who should be rudely bargin in on a white veil occasion
 but you are not the kind of boy
 who should be marryin the wrong girl i sneak in and see your friends
 and her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
 and she is yelling at a bridesmaid
 somewhere back inside a room
 wearing a gown shaped like a pastry
 this is surely not what you thought it would be
 i lose myself in a daydream
 where i stand and say dont say yes run away now
 ill meet you when youre out
 of the church at the back door
 dont wait or say a single vow
 you need to hear me out
 and they said speak now fond gestures are exchanged
 and the organ starts to play
 a song that sounds like a death march
 and i am hiding in the curtains
 it seems i was uninvited by your lovely bridetobe
 she floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
 but i know you wish it was me
 you wish it was me dont you dont say yes run away now
 ill meet you when youre out
 of the church at the back door
 dont wait or say a single vow
 you need to hear me out
 and they said speak now dont say yes run away now
 ill meet you when youre out
 of the church at the back door
 dont wait or say a single vow
 your time is running out
 and they said speak now i hear the preacher say
 speak now or forever hold your peace
 theres a silence theres my last chance
 i stand up with shaking hands
 all eyes on me
 horrified looks from everyone in the room
 but im only lookin at you i am not the kind of girl
 who should be rudely bargin in on a white veil occasion
 but you are not the kind of boy
 who should be marryin the wrong girl dont say yes run away now
 ill meet you when youre out
 of the church at the back door
 dont wait or say a single vow
 you need to hear me out
 and they said speak now and you say lets run away now
 ill meet you when im out of my tux at the back door
 oh baby i didnt say my vow
 so glad you were around when they said speak now loving him is like driving a new maserati down a deadend street
 faster than the wind passionate as sin ending so suddenly
 loving him is like trying to change your mind once youre already flying through the free fall
 like the colors in autumn so bright just before they lose it all losing him was blue like id never known
 missing him was dark grey all alone
 forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
 but loving him was red
 loving him was red touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
 memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
 fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing theres no right answer
 regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong losing him was blue like id never known
 missing him was dark gray all alone
 forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
 but loving him was red
 oh red
 burning red remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
 tell myself its time now gotta let go
 but moving on from him is impossible
 when i still see it all in my head
 burning red
 burning it was red oh losing him was blue like id never known
 missing him was dark gray all alone
 forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
 cause loving him was red
 yeah yeah red
 were burning red and thats why hes spinning round in my head
 comes back to me burning red
 yeah yeah
 his love was like driving a new maserati down a deadend street i remember tears streaming down your face when i said ill never let you go
 when all those shadows almost killed your light
 i remember you said dont leave me here alone
 but all thats dead and gone and passed tonight just close your eyes the sun is going down
 youll be alright no one can hurt you now
 come morning light you and ill be safe and sound dont you dare look out your window darling everythings on fire
 the war outside our door keeps raging on
 hold onto this lullaby even when the musics gone gone just close your eyes the sun is going down

 i was a dreamer before you went and let me down
 now its too late for you
 and your white horse to come around maybe i was naive
 got lost in your eyes
 and never really had a chance
 my mistake i didnt know to be in love
 you had to fight to have the upper hand
 i had so many dreams
 about you and me
 happy endings
 now i know im not a princess this aint a fairy tale
 im not the one youll sweep off her feet
 lead her up the stairwell
 this aint hollywood this is a small town
 i was a dreamer before you went and let me down
 now its too late for you
 and your white horse to come around and there you are on your knees
 begging for forgiveness begging for me
 just like i always wanted but im so sorry cause im not your princess this aint a fairytale
 im gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
 this is a big world that was a small town
 there in my rear view mirror disappearing now
 and its too late for you and your white horse
 now its too late for you and your white horse to catch me now oh whoa whoa whoa
 try and catch me now
 oh its too late
 to catch me now there i was again tonight forcing laughter faking smiles
 same old tired lonely place
 walls of insincerity
 shifting eyes and vacancy vanished when i saw your face
 all i can say is it was enchanting to meet you your eyes whispered have we met
 across the room your silhouette starts to make its way to me
 the playful conversation starts
 counter all your quick remarks like passing notes in secrecy
 and it was enchanting to meet you
 all i can say is i was enchanted to meet you this night is sparkling dont you let it go
 im wonder struck blushing all the way home
 ill spend forever wondering if you knew
 i was enchanted to meet you the lingering question kept me up
 two am who do you love
 i wonder till im wide awake
 now im pacing back and forth wishing you were at my door
 id open up and you would say hey
 it was enchanting to meet you
 all i know is i was enchanted to meet you this night is sparkling dont you let it go
 im wonder struck blushing all the way home
 ill spend forever wondering if you knew
 this night is flawless dont you let it go
 im wonder struck dancing around all alone
 ill spend forever wondering if you knew
 i was enchanted to meet you this is me praying that this was the very first page
 not where the story line ends
 my thoughts will echo your name until i see you again
 these are the words i held back as i was leaving too soon
 i was enchanted to meet you
 please dont be in love with someone else

 hows life tell me hows your family
 i havent seen them in a while
 youve been good busier then ever
 we small talk work and the weather
 your guard is up and i know why because the last time you saw me
 is still burned in the back of your mind
 you gave me roses and i left them there to die so this is me swallowing my pride
 standing in front of you saying im sorry for that night
 and i go back to december all the time
 it turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you
 wishing id realized what i had when you were mine
 id go back to december turn around and make it all right
 i go back to december all the time these days i havent been sleeping
 staying up playing back myself leaving
 when your birthday passed and i didnt call
 and i think about summer all the beautiful times
 i watched you laughing from the passenger side
 and realized id loved you in the fall
 and then the cold came the dark days when fear crept into my mind
 you gave me all your love and all i gave you was goodbye so this is me swallowing my pride
 standing in front of you saying im sorry for that night
 and i go back to december all the time
 it turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you
 wishing id realized what i had when you were mine
 id go back to december turn around and change my own mind
 i go back to december all the time i miss your tan skin your sweet smile so good to me so right
 and how you held me in your arms that september night
 the first time you ever saw me cry
 maybe this is wishful thinking
 probably mindless dreaming
 but if we loved again i swear id love you right id go back in time and change it but i cant
 so if the chain is on your door i understand but this is me swallowing my pride
 standing in front of you saying im sorry for that night
 and i go back to december
 it turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you
 wishing id realized what i had when you were mine
 id go back to december turn around and make it all right
 id go back to december turn around and change my own mind
 i go back to december all the time all the time once upon a time i believe it was a tuesday when i caught your eye
 and we caught onto something
 i hold onto the night you looked me in the eye and told me you loved me were you just kidding
 cause it seems to me this thing is breaking down
 we almost never speak
 i dont feel welcome anymore
 baby what happened please tell me cause one second it was perfect now youre halfway out the door and i stare at the phone he still hasnt called
 and then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
 and you flashback to when he said forever and always
 oh and it rains in your bedroom
 everything is wrong
 it rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
 cause i was there when you said forever and always was i out of line
 did i say something way too honest made you run and hide
 like a scared little boy
 i looked into your eyes
 thought i knew you for a minute now im not so sure so heres to everything coming down to nothing
 heres to silence that cuts me to the core
 where is this going thought i knew for a minute but i dont anymore and i stare at the phone he still hasnt called
 and then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
 and you flashback to when he said forever and always
 oh and it rains in your bedroom
 everything is wrong
 it rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
 cause i was there when you said forever and always you didnt mean it baby i dont think so oh back up baby back up
 did you forget everything
 back up baby back up
 did you forget everything cause it rains in your bedroom
 everything is wrong
 it rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
 cause i was there when you said forever and always oh i stare at the phone he still hasnt called
 and then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
 and you flashback to when we said forever and always and it rains in your bedroom
 everything is wrong
 it rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
 cause i was there when you said forever and always
 you didnt mean it baby
 you said forever and always yeah you take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
 its the morning of your very first day
 you say hi to your friends you aint seen in a while
 try and stay out of everybodys way its your freshman year and youre gonna be here
 for the next four years in this town
 hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
 you know i havent seen you around before cause when youre fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
 youre gonna believe them
 and when youre fifteen feeling like theres nothing to figure out but
 count to ten take it in
 this is life before you know who youre gonna be
 fifteen you sit in class next to redheaded abigail
 and soon enough youre best friends
 laughing at the other girls who think theyre so cool
 well be outta here as soon as we can and then youre on your very first date and hes got a car
 and you feeling like flying
 and your mamas waiting up and youre thinking hes the one
 and youre dancing round your room when the night ends
 when the night ends cause when youre fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
 youre gonna believe them
 and when youre fifteen and your first kiss
 makes your head spin around
 but in your life youll do things greater than
 dating the boy on the football team
 i didnt know it at fifteen when all you wanted was to be wanted
 i wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now back then i swore i was gonna marry him someday
 but i realized some bigger dreams of mine
 abigail gave everything she had to a boy who changed his mind
 we both cried cause when youre fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
 youre gonna believe them
 and when youre fifteen dont forget to love before you fall
 ive found time can heal most anything
 and you just might find who youre supposed to be
 i didnt know who i was supposed to be
 fifteen la la la la la
 your very first day

 and its a beautiful day
 and something reminds you

 never imagined wed end like this
 your name forever the name on my lips just like our last kiss

 oh oh oh you were in college working parttime waiting tables
 left a small town never looked back
 i was a flight risk with a fear of fallin
 wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts i say can you believe it
 as were lyin on the couch
 the moment i can see it
 yes yes i can see it now do you remember we were sittin there by the water
 you put your arm around me for the first time
 you made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
 you are the best thing thats ever been mine flash forward and were takin on the world together
 and theres a drawer of my things at your place
 you learn my secrets and you figure out why im guarded
 you say well never make my parents mistakes and we got bills to pay
 we got nothin figured out
 when it was hard to take
 yes yes
 this is what i thought about do you remember we were sittin there by the water
 you put your arm around me for the first time
 you made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
 you are the best thing thats ever been mine do you remember all the city lights on the water
 you saw me start to believe for the first time
 you made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
 you are the best thing thats ever been mine oh oh oh oh and i remember that fight twothirty am
 cause everything was slipping right out of our hands
 i ran out crying and you followed me out into the street braced myself for the goodbye
 cause thats all ive ever known

 shes upset
 shes going off about something that you said
 cause she doesnt get your humor like i do
 im in my room
 its a typical tuesday night
 im listening to the kind of music she doesnt like
 and shell never know your story like i do but she wears short skirts
 i wear tshirts
 shes cheer captain
 and im on the bleachers
 dreaming about the day when you wake up
 and find that what youre looking for has been here the whole time if you can see im the one who understands you
 been here all along so why cant you see
 you belong with me
 you belong with me walkin the streets with you and your wornout jeans
 i cant help thinking this is how it ought to be
 laughing on a park bench thinking to myself
 hey isnt this easy and youve got a smile that could light up this whole town
 i havent seen it in a while since she brought you down
 you say your fine
 i know you better then that
 hey what you doing with a girl like that she wears high heels
 i wear sneakers
 shes cheer captain and im on the bleachers
 dreaming about the day when you wake up
 and find that what what youre looking for has been here the whole time if you can see that im the one who understands you
 been here all along so why cant you see
 you belong with me standing by and waiting at your back door
 all this time how could you not know
 baby you belong with me
 you belong with me oh i remember you drivin to my house in the middle of the night
 im the one who makes you laugh
 when you know youre about to cry
 and i know your favorite songs
 and you tell me about your dreams
 i think i know where you belong
 i think i know its with me cant you see that im the one who understands you
 been here all along so why cant you see
 you belong with me standing by and waiting at your back door
 all this time
 how could you not know
 baby you belong with me
 you belong with me you belong with me
 have you ever thought just maybe
 you belong with me
 you belong with me elevator buttons and morning air
 strangers silence makes me want to take the stairs
 if you were here wed laugh about their vacant stares
 but right now
 my time is theirs seems like theres always
 someone who disapproves
 theyll judge it like they know about me and you
 and the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
 the jurys out
 and my choice is you so dont you worry your pretty little mind
 people throw rocks at things that shine
 and life makes love look hard
 the stakes are high
 the waters rough
 but this love is ours you never know what people have up their sleeves
 ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
 lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
 but i dont care
 cause right now youre mine
 and you say so dont you worry your pretty little mind
 people throw rocks at things that shine
 and life makes love look hard
 the stakes are high
 the waters rough
 but this love is ours and its not theirs to speculate
 if its wrong and
 your hands are tough but they are where
 my belong in
 ill fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you cause i love the gap between your teeth
 and i love the riddles that you speak
 and any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored
 cause my heart is yours so dont you worry your pretty little mind
 people throw rocks at things that shine
 and life makes love look hard and dont you worry your pretty little mind
 people throw rocks at things that shine
 but they cant take whats ours
 they cant take whats ours
 the stakes are high
 the waters rough
 but this love is ours he said lets get out of this town
 drive out of the city
 away from the crowds
 i thought heaven cant help me now
 nothing lasts forever
 but this is gonna take me down
 hes so tall and handsome as hell
 hes so bad but he does it so well
 i can see the end as it begins my one condition is say youll remember me
 standing in a nice dress staring at the sunset babe
 red lips and rosy cheeks
 say youll see me again even if its just in your wildest dreams ah ah
 wildest dreams ah ah i said no one has to know what we do
 his hands are in my hair his clothes are in my room
 and his voice is a familiar sound nothing lasts forever
 but this is getting good now
 hes so tall and handsome as hell
 hes so bad but he does it so well
 and when weve had our very last kiss
 but my last request is say youll remember me
 standing in a nice dress staring at the sunset babe
 red lips and rosy cheeks
 say youll see me again even if its just in your wildest dreams ah ah ah ah
 wildest dreams ah ah you see me in hindsight
 tangled up with you all night
 burn it down
 some day when you leave me
 i bet these memories hunt you around
 you see me in hindsight
 tangled up with you all night
 burn it down burn it down
 some day when you leave me
 i bet these memories follow you around follow you around say youll remember me
 standing in a nice dress staring at the sunset babe
 red lips and rosy cheeks

 standing in a nice dress staring at the sunset babe
 red lips and rosy cheeks
 say youll see me again even if its just just pretend just pretend in your wildest dreams ah ah

 he didnt like it when i wore high heels
 but i do
 turn the lock and put my headphones on
 he always said he didnt get this song
 but i do i do walked in expecting youd be late
 but you got here early and you stand and wave
 i walk to you
 you pull my chair out and help me in
 and you dont know how nice that is
 but i do and you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
 i think its strange that you think im funny cause he never did
 ive been spending the last eight months
 thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
 but on a wednesday in a cafe i watched it begin again you said you never met one girl
 who had as many james taylor records as you
 but i do
 we tell stories and you dont know why
 im coming off a little shy
 but i do but you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
 i think its strange that you think im funny cause he never did ive been spending the last eight months
 thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
 but on a wednesday in a cafe i watched it begin again and we walked down the block to my car and i almost brought him up
 but you start to talk about the movies that your family watches
 every single christmas and i want to talk about that
 and for the first time whats past is past cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
 i think its strange that you think im funny cause he never did
 ive been spending the last eight months thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
 but on a wednesday in a cafe i watched it begin again but on a wednesday in a cafe i watched it begin again i was riding shotgun with my hair undone in the front seat of his car
 hes got a onehand feel on the steering wheel
 the other on my heart
 i look around turn the radio down
 he says baby is something wrong
 i say nothin i was just thinkin how we dont have a song
 and he said our song is a slamming screen door
 sneakin out late tapping on your window
 when were on the phone and you talk real slow
 cause its late and your mama dont know
 our song is the way you laugh on the first date
 man i didnt kiss her and i should have
 and when i got home before i said amen
 asking god if he could play it again i was walking up the front porch steps after everything that day
 had gone all wrong and been trampled on
 and lost and thrown away
 got to the hallway well on my way to my lovin bed
 i almost didnt notice all the roses
 and the note that said our song is a slamming screen door
 sneakin out late tapping on your window
 when were on the phone and you talk real slow
 cause its late and your mama dont know
 our song is the way you laugh on the first date
 man i didnt kiss her and i should have
 and when i got home before i said amen
 asking god if he could play it again ive heard every album listened to the radio
 waited for something to come along
 that was as good as our song cause our song is a slamming screen door
 sneaking out late tapping on his window
 when were on the phone and he talks real slow
 cause its late and his mama dont know
 our song is the way he laughs on the first date
 man i didnt kiss him and i should have
 and when i got home before i said amen
 asking god if he could play it again
 play it again oh yeah oh oh yeah i was riding shotgun with my hair undone
 in the front seat of his car
 i grabbed a pen and an old napkin
 and i wrote down our song the way you move is like a full on rainstorm
 and im a house of cards
 youre the kind of reckless that should send me running
 but i kinda know that i wont get far and you stood there in front of me just
 close enough to touch
 close enough to hope you couldnt see
 what i was thinking of drop everything now
 meet me in the pouring rain
 kiss me on the sidewalk
 take away the pain
 cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile get me with those green eyes baby
 as the lights go down
 gimme something thatll haunt me whenever youre not around
 cause i see sparks fly when you smile my mind forgets to remind me your a bad idea
 you touch me once and its really something
 you find im even better than you imagined i would be
 im on my guard for the rest of the world
 but with you i know its no good
 and i could wait patiently
 but i really wish you would drop everything now
 meet me in the pouring rain
 kiss me on the sidewalk
 take away the pain
 cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile get me with those green eyes baby
 as the lights go down
 gimme something thatll haunt me when youre not around
 cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile i run my fingers through your hair
 and watch the lights go wild
 just keep on keeping your eyes on me
 its just wrong enough to make it feel right
 and lead me up the staircase
 wont you whisper soft and slow
 and im captivated by you baby
 like a fireworks show drop everything now
 meet me in the pouring rain
 kiss me on the sidewalk
 take away the pain
 cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile get me with those green eyes baby
 as the lights go down

 cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile when sparks fly oh baby smile
 when sparks fly looking at it now

 when it all broke down and the story of us
 looks a lot like a tragedy now next chapter howd we end up this way
 see me nervously pulling at my clothes
 and trying to look busy
 and youre doing your best to avoid me
 im starting to think one day ill tell the story of us
 how i was losing my mind when i saw you here
 but you held your pride like you should have held me
 oh im scared to see the ending
 why are we pretending this is nothing
 id tell you i miss you but i dont know how
 ive never heard silence quite this loud now im standing alone in a crowded room
 and were not speaking and im dying to know
 is it killing you like its killing me yeah
 i dont know what to say since the twist of fate
 when it all broke down and the story of us
 looks a lot like a tragedy now this is looking like a contest
 of who can act like they care less
 but i liked it better when you were on my side
 the battles in your hands now
 but i would lay my armor down
 if youd say youd rather love than fight
 so many things that you wish i knew
 but the story of us might be ending soon now im standing alone in a crowded room
 and were not speaking and im dying to know
 is it killing you like its killing me yeah
 i dont know what to say since the twist of fate
 when it all broke down and the story of us
 looks a lot like a tragedy now the end i walked through the door with you the air was cold
 but something bout it felt like home somehow and i
 left my scarf there at your sisters house
 and you still got it in your drawer even now oh your sweet disposition and my wideeyed gaze
 were singing in the car getting lost upstate
 the autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
 and i can picture it after all these days and i know its long gone
 and that magics not here no more
 and i might be okay
 but im not fine at all cause there we are again on that little town street
 you almost ran the red cause you were looking over me
 wind in my hair i was there i remember it all too well photo album on the counter your cheeks were turning red
 you used to be a little kid with glasses in a twinsize bed
 and your mothers telling stories about you on a tee ball team
 you tell me bout your past thinking your future was me and i know its long gone
 and there was nothing else i could do
 and i forget about you long enough
 to forget why i needed to cause there we are again in the middle of the night
 we dance around the kitchen in the refrigerator light
 down the stairs i was there i remember it all too well yeah maybe we got lost in translation maybe i asked for too much
 and maybe this thing was a masterpiece til you tore it all up
 running scared i was there i remember it all too well hey you call me up again just to break me like a promise
 so casually cruel in the name of being honest
 im a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
 cause i remember it all all all too well time wont fly its like im paralyzed by it
 id like to be my old self again but im still trying to find it
 after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
 now you mail back my things and i walk home alone but you keep my old scarf from that very first week
 cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
 you cant get rid of it cause you remember it all too well yeah cause there we are again when i loved you so
 back before you lost the one real thing youve ever known
 it was rare i was there i remember it all too well wind in my hair you were there you remember it all
 down the stairs you were there you remember it all
 it was rare i was there i remember it all too well ive never gone with the wind just let it flow
 let it take me where it wants
 til you opened the door theres so much more
 ive never seen it before
 i was trying to fly but i couldnt find wings
 but you came along and you changed everything you lift my feet off the ground
 you spin me around
 you make me crazier crazier
 feels like im falling and im lost in your eyes
 you make me crazier crazier crazier i watched from a distance as you made life your own
 every sky was your own kind of blue
 and i wanted to know how that would feel
 and you made it so real
 you showed me something that i couldnt see
 you opened my eyes and you made me believe you lift my feet off the ground
 you spin me around
 you make me crazier crazier
 feels like im falling and im lost in your eyes
 you make me craziercraziercrazier oh baby you showed me what livin is for

 ive got my big coat on i hear your laugh
 and look up smiling at you
 i run and run
 past the pumpkin patch
 and the tractor rides
 look now the sky is gold
 i hug your legs
 and fall asleep on the way home i dont know why all the trees change in the fall
 but i know youre not scared of anything at all
 dont know if snow whites house is near or far away
 but i know i had the best day with you today im thirteen now
 and dont know how
 my friends could be so mean
 i come home crying
 and you hold me tight
 and grab the keys and we drive and drive
 until we found a town far enough away
 and we talk and window shop
 till i forgotten all their names i dont know who im gonna talk to now at school
 but i know im laughing
 on the car ride home with you
 dont know how long its gonna take to feel okay
 but i know i had the best day with you today i have an excellent father
 his strength is making me stronger
 god smiles on my little brother
 inside and out hes better than i am
 i grew up in a pretty house
 and i had space to run and i
 had the best days with you there is a video i found
 from back when i was three
 you set up a paint set in the kitchen
 and youre talking to me
 its the age of princesses and pirate ships
 and the seven dwarfs
 and daddys smart
 and youre the prettiest lady in the whole wide world and now i know why the all the trees change in the fall
 i know you were on my side
 even when i was wrong
 and i love you for giving me your eyes
 staying back and watching me shine and i didnt know if you knew
 so im taking this chance to say
 that i had the best day with you today i see your face in my mind as i drive away
 cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
 people are people

 welcome to new york i said remember this moment
 in the back of my mind
 the time we stood with our shaking hands
 the crowds in stands went wild
 we were the kings and the queens
 and they read off our names
 the night you danced like you knew our lives
 would never be the same
 you held your head like a hero
 on a history book page
 it was the end of a decade
 but the start of an age long live the walls we crashed through
 all the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
 i was screaming long live all the magic we made
 and bring on all the pretenders
 one day we will be remembered i said remember this feeling
 i passed the pictures around
 of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
 wishing for right now
 we are the kings and the queens
 you traded your baseball cap for a crown
 when they gave us our trophies
 and we held them up for our town
 and the cynics were outraged
 screaming this is absurd
 cause for a moment a band of thieves in ripped up jeans got to rule the world long live the walls we crashed through
 all the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
 i was screaming long live all the magic we made
 and bring on all the pretenders
 im not afraid long live all the mountains we moved
 i had the time of my life
 fighting dragons with you
 i was screaming long live the look on your face
 and bring on all the pretenders
 one day we will be remembered hold on to spinning around
 confetti falls to the ground
 may these memories break our fall can you take a moment
 promise me this
 that youll stand by me forever
 but if god forbid fate should step in
 and force us into a goodbye
 if you have children someday
 when they point to the pictures
 please tell them my name
 tell them how the crowds went wild
 tell them how i hope they shine long live the walls we crashed through
 i had the time of my life with you long long live the walls we crashed through
 all the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
 and i was screaming long live all the magic we made
 and bring on all the pretenders
 im not afraid singing long live all the mountains we moved
 i had the time of my life
 fighting dragons with you
 and long long live the look on your face
 and bring on all the pretenders
 one day we will be remembered clear blue water
 high tide came and brought you in
 and i could go on and on on and on
 and i will scars grow darker currents swept you out again
 and you were just gone and gone gone and gone
 in silent screams and wildest dreams
 i never dreamed of this this love is good
 this love is bad
 this love is a life back from the dead oh
 these hands had to let it go free
 and this love came back to me oh
 oh oh tossing turning struggle through the night for someone new
 and i could go on and on on and on

 but you were still gone gone gone

 sounded like footsteps on my stairs
 six months gone and im still reaching
 even though i know youre not there
 i was playing back a thousand memories baby
 thinking bout everything weve been through
 maybe ive been going back too much lately
 when time stood still and i had you come back come back come back to me like
 you would you would if this was a movie
 stand in the rain outside til i came out
 come back come back come back to me like
 you could you could if you just said youre sorry
 i know that we could work it out somehow
 but if this was a movie youd be here by now i know people change and these things happen
 but i remember how it was back then
 locked up in your arms and our friends are laughing
 cause nothing like this ever happened to them
 now im pacing up the hall chasing down your street
 flashback to a night when you said to me
 nothings gonna change not for me and you
 not before i knew how much i had to lose come back come back come back to me like
 you would you would if this was a movie
 stand in the rain outside til i came out

 wary since youve been gone
 i just want it back the way it was before
 and i just want to see you back at my front door
 and i say come back come back come back to me like

 before the fight before i locked you out

 but if this was a movie youd be here by now youd be here by now
 its not the kind of ending you wanna see now
 baby i dont like the ending
 oh i thought youd be here now whoa
 thought youd be here by now im walking fast through the traffic lights
 busy streets and busy lives
 and all we know is touch and go
 we are alone with our changing minds
 we fall in love till it hurts or bleeds or fades in time and i never saw you coming
 and ill never be the same you come around and the armor falls
 pierce the room like a cannon ball
 now all we know is dont let go
 we are alone just you and me
 up in your room and our slates are clean
 just twin fire signs four blue eyes so you were never a saint
 and i love in shades of wrong
 we learn to live with the pain
 mosaic broken hearts
 but this love is brave and wild and i never saw you coming
 and ill never be the same this is a state of grace
 this is the worth while fight
 love is a ruthless game
 unless you play it good and right
 these are the hands of fate
 youre my achilles heel
 this is the golden age of something good
 and right and real and i never saw you coming
 and ill never be the same and i never saw you coming
 and ill never be the same this is a state of grace
 this is a worth while fight
 love is a ruthless game
 unless you play it good and right been sitting eyes wide open behind these four walls hoping youd call
 its just a cruel existence like theres no point hoping at all baby baby i feel crazy up all night all night and every day
 give me something oh but you say nothing
 what is happening to me i dont wanna live forever cause i know ill be living in vain
 and i dont wanna fit wherever
 i just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
 i just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
 i just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home im sitting eyes wide open and i got one thing stuck in my mind
 wondering if i dodged a bullet or just lost the love of my life oh baby baby i feel crazy
 up all night all night and every day
 i gave you something but you gave me nothing
 what is happening to me i dont wanna live forever cause i know ill be living in vain
 and i dont wanna fit fit babe wherever wherever
 i just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
 i just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
 i just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home ive been looking sad in all the nicest places
 baby baby i feel crazy
 i see you around in all these empty faces
 up all night all night and every day
 ive been looking sad in all the nicest places
 give me something oh but you say nothing
 now im in a cab i tell em where your place is
 what is happening to me i dont wanna live forever cause i know ill be living in vain
 and i dont wanna fit wherever
 i just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
 i just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home

 i just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
 i just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home i just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
 until you come back home and its a sad picture the final hits you
 somebody else gets what you wanted again and
 you know its all the same another time and place
 repeating history and youre getting sick of it
 but i believe in whatever you do
 and ill do anything to see it through because these things will change
 can you feel it now
 these walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
 its a revolution the time will come
 for us to finally win
 and well sing hallelujah well sing hallelujah so weve been outnumbered
 raided and now cornered
 its hard to fight when the fight aint fair
 were getting stronger now
 find things they never found
 they might be bigger
 but were faster and never scared
 you can walk away say we dont need this
 but theres something in your eyes
 says we can beat this because these things will change
 can you feel it now
 these walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
 its a revolution the time will come
 for us to finally win
 and well sing hallelujah well sing hallelujah tonight well stand get off our knees
 fight for what weve worked for all these years
 and the battle was long its the fight of our lives
 but well stand up champions tonight it was the night things changed
 can you see it now
 these walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
 its a revolution throw your hands up
 cause we never gave in
 and well sing hallelujah we sang hallelujah
 hallelujah i wish i was strong enough to lift not one but both of us
 some day i will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us ever thought about losing it
 when your moneys all gone and you lose your whip
 you might lose your grip when the landlord tell ya that youre due for rent
 and the grass so green on the other side
 make a n wanna run straight through the fence
 open up the fridge bout twenty times
 but still cant find no food in it
 thats foolishness
 and sometimes i wonder why we care so much about the way we look
 and the way we talk and the way we act
 and the clothes we bought how much that cost
 does it even really matter
 cause if life is an uphill battle
 we all tryna climb with the same ol ladder
 in the same boat with the same ol paddle
 why so shallow im just asking
 whats the pattern for the madness
 everybody aint a number one draft pick
 most of us aint hollywood actors
 but if its all for one and one for all
 then maybe one day we all can ball
 do it one time for the underdogs
 sincerely yours from one of yall i wish i was strong enough to lift not one but both of us
 some day i will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us i can feel your pain i can feel your struggle
 you just wanna live been everything so low
 that you could drown in a puddle
 thats why i gotta hold us up yeah hold us up
 for all the times no ones ever spoke for us
 to every single time that they play this song
 you can say that thats what bobby ray wrote for us
 when the tides get too high
 and the sea up underneath get so deep
 and you feel like youre just another person
 getting lost in the crowd way up high in the nosebleed
 uh because we wont be near yet both of us
 but we still stand tall with our shoulders up
 and even though we always against the odds
 these are the things that have molded us
 and if life hadnt chosen us
 sometimes i wonder where i wouldve wound up
 cause if it was up to me id make a new blueprint
 then build it from the ground up hey
 but if its all for one and one for all
 then maybe one day we all can ball
 do it one time for the underdogs
 from bobby ray to all of yall i wish i was strong enough to lift not one but both of us
 some day i will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us she cant see the way your eyes
 light up when you smile

 sophistication isnt what you wear or who you know

 and life was never worse but never better eh

 too in love to think straight
 all alone or so it seemed
 but there were strangers watching
 and whispers turned to talking
 and talking turned to screams didnt they tell us dont rush into things
 didnt you flash your green eyes at me
 didnt you call my fears with the treacherous cats smile
 ooh didnt it all seem new and exciting

 men just for you
 time moved too fast
 you played it back
 buttons on a coat
 light hearted joke
 no proof not much
 but you saw enough
 small talk he drives
 coffee at midnight the light reflects
 the chain on your neck
 he says look up
 and your shoulders brush
 no proof one touch
 you felt enough you can hear it in the silence silence you
 you can feel it on the way home way home you
 you can see it with the lights out lights out
 you are in love true love
 you are in love morning his place
 burnt toast sunday
 you keep his shirt
 he keeps his word
 and for once you let go
 of your fears and your ghosts
 one step not much but it said enough
 you kissed on sidewalks
 you fight and you talk
 one night he wakes strange look on his face
 pauses then says youre my best friend
 and you knew what it was he is in love you can hear it in the silence silence you
 you can feel it on the way home way home you
 you can see it with the lights out lights out
 you are in love true love so it goes
 you two are dancing in a snow globe go round and round
 and he keeps the picture of you in his office downtown
 you understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars
 and why ive spent my whole life try to put it into words cause you can hear in the silence
 you can feel it on the way home
 you can see it with the lights out
 you are in love true love
 youre in love you can hear it in the silence silence you

 as long as they dont touch
 out of focus eye to eye
 till the gravitys too much
 and ill do anything you say
 if you say it with your hands
 and id be smart to walk away
 but youre quicksand this slope is treacherous
 this path is reckless
 this slope is treacherous
 and i i i like it i cant decide if its a choice
 getting swept away
 i hear the sound of my own voice
 asking you to stay
 and all we are is skin and bone
 trained to get along
 forever going with the flow
 but youre friction this slope is treacherous
 this path is reckless
 this slope is treacherous
 i i i like it two headlights shine through the sleepless night
 and i will get you and get you alone
 your name has echoed through my mind
 and i just think you should think you should know
 that nothing safe is worth the drive and i would
 follow you follow you home
 ill follow you follow you home this hope is treacherous
 this daydream is dangerous
 this hope is treacherous
 i i i i i i i i i two headlights shine through the sleepless night
 and i will get you and get you alone
 your name has echoed through my mind
 and i just think you should think you should know
 that nothing safe is worth the drive and i will
 follow you follow you home
 ill follow you follow you home
 ill follow you follow you home
 ill follow you follow you home this slope is treacherous
 i i i like it i said oh my what a marvelous tune
 it was the best night never would forget how we moved
 the whole place was dressed to the nines
 and we were dancing dancing
 like were made of starlight
 like were made of starlight i met bobby on the boardwalk summer of 45
 picked me up late one night at the window
 we were seventeen and crazy running wild wild
 cant remember what song he was playing when we walked in
 the night we snuck into a yacht club party
 pretending to be a duchess and a prince and i said oh my what a marvelous tune
 it was the best night never would forget how we moved
 the whole place was dressed to the nines
 and we were dancing dancing
 like were made of starlight starlight
 like were made of starlight starlight he said look at you worrying so much about things you cant change
 youll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way
 he was trying to skip rocks on the ocean saying to me
 dont you see the starlight starlight
 dont you dream impossible things like oh my what a marvelous tune
 it was the best night never would forget how we moved
 the whole place was dressed to the nines
 and we were dancing dancing

 ooh ooh dancing with me
 ooh ooh we could get married

 and we were dancing dancing

 dont you see the starlight starlight
 dont you dream impossible things i remember your bare feet down the hallway
 i remember your little laugh
 race cars on the kitchen floor
 plastic dinosaurs i love you to the moon and back i remember your blue eyes looking into mine like we had our own secret club
 i remember you dancing before bed time then jumping on me waking me up
 i can still feel you hold my hand
 little man from even that moment i knew
 you fought it hard like an army guy
 remember i leaned in and whispered to you come on baby with me
 were gonna fly away from here
 you were my best four years i remember the drive home when the blind hope
 turned to crying and screaming why
 flowers piled up in the worst way
 no one knows what to say about a beautiful boy who died and its about to be halloween
 you could be anything you wanted if you were still here i remember the last day when i kissed your face
 i whispered in your ear come on baby with me
 were gonna fly away from here
 out of this curtained room in this hospital
 well just disappear
 come on baby with me
 were gonna fly away from here
 you were my best four years what if im standing in your closet trying to talk to you
 what if i kept the hand me downs you wont grow into
 and what if i really thought some miracle would see us through
 but what if the miracle was even getting one moment with you come on baby with me
 were gonna fly away from here
 come on baby with me
 were gonna fly away from here
 you were my best four years i remember your bare feet down the hallway
 i love you to the moon and back
